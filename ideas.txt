Structure: 

@months =   {
  January => [{category: "groceries", amount: 350, todate: 0, items: {item1=>cost1, item2=>cost2} } {category: "mortgage", amount: 1395, todate: 0 items: { }}], 
  February => [{category: "groceries", amount: 350, todate: 50}, {category: "mortgage", amount: 1395, todate: 0}]
}

- fix the top item not deleting from editing a budget's items
- instead of using an id number to refer to the row of the table within the month view, use the category name
- add in security code:
  - when add budget category: must enter name and amount must integer
  - same for when editing the budget category


-  need to fix error_for_item_name method. doesn't work
- need to fix cancel button to get back when trying to add a new category
