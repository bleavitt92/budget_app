1. Need a button on homepage to see monthly view. On this page show the month, budget, total spent, and amount over or under
EX: Month | Budget | Total Spending | Difference
    Jan   | $2500  | $2100          | $400


2. Need a button to "archive" the month
  - create data structure to hold the "archived" months. 

  {
    January => [{category: "groceries", amount: 350, todate: 50}, {category: "mortgage", amount: 1395, todate: 0}], 
    February => [{category: "groceries", amount: 350, todate: 50}, {category: "mortgage", amount: 1395, todate: 0}]
  }

  - reset the @budget to []

3. NEW IDEAS
- create a new structure
- on home page keep the category and monthly budget. Keep the new budget category button
- have all months in a line as links at the bottom of the page. Each time you click a month, you will be taken to a table that looks like what the current home page is with category, monthly budget, to-date spending, and amount left.  





Structure: 

@budget = [{category: "groceries", amount: 350, todate: 50}, {category: "mortgage", amount: 1395, todate: 0}]
